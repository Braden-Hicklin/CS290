# Serverside Scripting
## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to implement some serverside scripting into a webpage. I used python, javascript, css, and html for
this particular project. I used python to set up my server and to perform the cgi scripts, javascript to run some basic onclick 
functions, and css and html for style and driver code respectfully.
## Outline
The basic outline of this webpage was to create a simple login/signup functionality. I will use python to check and register the 
user and send them to a new webpage based on whether they are a new or returning user. Eventually I would like to have the inputs 
of the user to update a database file that loads in with the server each time to avoid duplicate users. For now, I just stuck with
setting up the functionality of logging in/signing up.
