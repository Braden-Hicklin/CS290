Design for a Webpage
I am currently working on a game in Unreal 5 so I would want to make a webpage for the game including updates, screenshots, artwork, current roadmap, and more.

Stylistically what the webpage should include:
1. Logo with the game title
2. 5 Tabs: Home, Artwork, Screenshots, Roadmap, Q&A

TABS:
1. Homepage
  - The homepage should include a basic setup with the logo in the top left corner
  - Brief expository section about the game
  - Video trailer and/or vidoes of current development
  - Links to resources used for development like UE, Previous Source code, and libraries
  
2. Artwork
  - List of the entitites and items featured in the game
  - Sublinks attached to the listed items that let you choose which one to look at
  - Concept art, models, animations, and sfx as well as expository pieces for each
  - Links to Resources
  
3. Screenshots
  - Serve as an update bank of screenshots and current progress with the game
  - Try to avoid having duplicate screenshots already shown in the artwork section

4. Roadmap
  - Show current roadmap and development progress along with some information about future updates and improvement areas
  
5. Q&A (BIG MAYBE)
  - Place where I post commonly asked questions along with their answers and a questions box where questions can be sent to
