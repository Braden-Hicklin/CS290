The design I have in mind for this webpage would be one that lets you learn about various muscle groups on the human body
along with their associated movemnets, supporting muscles, and exercises you can do to improve them.
Basic title with description
Large image of a human muscle structure front and back
Hovering over the muscle would allow you to read about it 
Due to a lack of experience this time around I hope to simply have an image that has a text popup on interaction with the image
This can either be when clicking the image or when hovering over it, I will attempt for the effect to be produced upon hovering
over the image but if that proves to be beyond my current capabilities I will just stick with when its clicked.
