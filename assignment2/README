The design I have in mind for this webpage would be one that lets you learn about various muscle groups on the human body
along with their associated movemnets, supporting muscles, and exercises you can do to improve them.
Basic title with description
Large image of a human muscle structure front and back
Hovering over the muscle would allow you to read about it
