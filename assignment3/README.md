# This website will be an improved version of the muscle anatomy website created in the previous assignment (assignment2)

## Premise:
The basis of this website is to serve as an interactive muscle anatomy chart that shows what the muscle is used for, how it moves, what stretches are best for them,
and what exercises work best for strengthening them.

## Additions:
In the previous assignment I created a basic outline for the website, in this one I will create some interaction and polish using imagemaps, searchboxes, @mediatype, nav bars, and more.

This rendition will only include three interactable muscles, so I can focus on polishing up other areas of the website
There will also be a search bar that allows the user to type the muscles name in and learn even more about the muscle, however this funciton will be cosmetic for now.
There will be three tabs in the top of the webpage for Home, references, and an about section.
When hovering over a muscle, a brief summary of the muscles function will popup.
