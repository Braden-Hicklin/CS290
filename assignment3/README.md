# This website will be an improved version of the muscle anatomy website created in the previous assignment (assignment2)

## Premise:
The basis of this website is to serve as an interactive muscle anatomy chart that shows what the muscle is used for, how it moves, what stretches are best for them,
and what exercises work best for strengthening them.

## Additions:
In the previous assignment I created a basic outline for the website, in this one I will create some degree of interaction using imagemaps, searchboxes, drop down menus,
and more.
