# This website will be an improved version of the muscle anatomy website created in the previous assignment (assignment2)

## Premise:
The basis of this website is to serve as an interactive muscle anatomy chart that shows what the muscle is used for, how it moves, what stretches are best for them,
and what exercises work best for strengthening them.

## Additions:
In the previous assignment I created a basic outline for the website, in this one I will create some degree of interaction using imagemaps, searchboxes, drop down menus,
and more.

This rendition will only include three interactable muscles, so I can focus on polishing up the way the interactions work.
There will also be a search bar that allows the user to type the muscles name in and learn even more about the muscle.
When hovering over a muscle, a brief summary of the muscles function, as well as an optimal exercise and stretch associated with the muscle will popup.
When searching for a muscle, a more in depth summary of the muscles function/anatomy will appear along with drop down menus that let the user look for exercises 
and stretches.
