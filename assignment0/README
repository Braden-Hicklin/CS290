Five websites with aspects that I either like or dislike:
1. Boohooman's Website: https://www.boohooman.com/us/
- I like the overall simplicity of the websites design as it helps navigate through the clothing options fairly easily
- I don't like the varying fonts and flashy designs to different tabs at the top and throughout the sites sublinks
- If I were to improve upon this site I would make the overall design consistent across the board rather than change it based on the topic and/or style of clothing
2. Newegg: https://www.newegg.com
- I like the amount of information and options you are presented with immediately as it limits the amount of manual searching you would have to do if the product you
  looking for is commonplace. However, this is also a negative as it causes an excessive amount of clutter
- My biggest suggestion for this website would be to improve the sidebar by cleaning it up, maybe personalize it more to the buyer rather than the collective 
3. GNC's Website: https://www.gnc.com
- I personally don't like GNC's website, in particular their lack of immediate options makes for a less than comfortable experience when trying to traverse the store's
  options. I would drastically improve this by actually adding more to the top bar, moving the promotion items down a bit and having a section that allows for a more 
  precise search rather than simple vague sublinks
4. Craigslist: https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites
- I like the simplicity of the website, but I also feel its quite dated. The website lacks personality and flare that do more than just serve as embellishment. By
  having more colorful and visually appealing designs the users also feel a sense of direction, when looking at slate white website with nothing but blue sublinks it 
  can throw you off and bore you out of focus.
5. Amazon: www.amazon.com
- There truly isn't anything I would say is wrong with amazon's website. It is quite literally engineered to be the most precise and personalized shopping center 
  available and it does so with great accuracy. Excluding its questionable ethics on how it collects and analyzes user interests, its execution and delivery is textbook
  and should inspire any website looking for consistent traffic and returning customers.
